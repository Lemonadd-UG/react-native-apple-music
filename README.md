The React Native About Libraries package is on a similar concept of [AboutLibraries](https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries). We would like to credit this library to all the [AboutLibraries](https://github.com/mikepenz/AboutLibraries) contributors

Here's a quick overview of functionalities supported:

* Listing of used open source libraries
* Provision for adding app section (optional)
* Autodetect installed packages
* Auto Font Scaling
* Much much more... try the sample for a quick overview.

## 💖 Support my projects
I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications for free! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:
* Starring and sharing the projects you like 🚀
* If you're feeling especially charitable, please follow [prscX](https://github.com/prscX) on GitHub.
